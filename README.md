üîç Key Features:

Mission Timeline: 
     From launch to landing, a comprehensive view of key events.

Data Visualizations:
     Interactive graphs on mission milestones, lunar surface exploration, and scientific discoveries.
Real-Time Metrics: 
     Live tracking of mission updates, fuel consumption, and orbital movements.
Insights: 
    How the mission's success contributes to space research, international partnerships, and technological innovations.
    
üí° This project showcases my skills in data visualization, storytelling with data, and using Power BI for real-time monitoring of complex projects.

I'm proud to contribute to the excitement of India's achievements in space exploration! üåå
